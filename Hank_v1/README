ABOUT:
	Hank is a basic command line virtual assistant. At hte time of his creation, I have had very minimal advanced programming. Most of my programming experience is Scientific, so I am familiar with python.

Hank will be getting improvements. Some prospects include:
 User interface
	Voice interface
	Personnel files
		
He currently performs the following tasks:
	Animated face movements while talking
	Tells the time as well as date and such
	Reports the weather, retrieved from nearest Regional Airport
	Tells jokes
	Reads the first sentence of a prompted Wikipedia page
This version of Hank does not have an interface yet. You must therefore call the function you wish Hank to do within the python script before running it. He has not been tested on anything earlier than 3.9, but works perfect with python 3.9 - python 3.11.
